"""

Write a synchronous function that makes a directory and recursively makes all of its parent
directories as necessary.

A directory is specified via a sequence of arguments which specify the path. For example:

mkdirp('/','tmp','made','some','dir')
...will make the directory /tmp/made/some/dir.

Like the shell command mkdir -p, the function you program should be idempotent if the directory
already exists.
